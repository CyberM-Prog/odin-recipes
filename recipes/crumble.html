<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A family favorite, this apple crumble was originally my grandmother Hazel's recipe which my mom made on a regular basis. She would make two at a time to take to sick or shut-in friends, or to potlucks. There is never any left. Serve warm with French vanilla yogurt.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>7 large Cortland apples - peeled, cored, and sliced </li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste </li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>Spread apples in an even layer in a deep dish pie plate or 8-inch square glass casserole dish. Cover with white sugar, then top with cinnamon.
    </li>
    <li>Combine flour and brown sugar for topping in a bowl. Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender. Spread topping evenly over apple mixture and pat down.
    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until apple mixture is bubbling and topping is browned, about 55 minutes.
    </li>
